  "reflection": "Through curating this portfolio, I learned how performing arts powerfully support inclusion, identity and emotional expression in early childhood. I am most confident leading dance and music experiences because I enjoy rhythm and group energy. Drama activities require more planning and confidence, especially when facilitating improvisation. I now see performing arts not as add-ons but as essential pedagogical tools for communication, belonging and self-regulation‚Äîparticularly for multilingual and neurodiverse learners. Going forward, I will continue to explore songs and dances from my own Nepali background and the cultures represented in my classrooms, and I will keep refining adaptations (visual supports, sensory-friendly pacing, AAC) to ensure that every child can access, participate and flourish.",
